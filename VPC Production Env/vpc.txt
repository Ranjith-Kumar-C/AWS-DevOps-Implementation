- To login to the instance in the terminal

 ssh -i "neww.pem" ubuntu@35.174.241.200

-i option in the ssh command specifies the identity file (private key) to be used for public key authentication when connecting to a remote server.This tells SSH to use the private key for authentication when connecting to the remote server hostname as the user user.
