Tagging images before pushing them to Docker Hub (or any container registry) serves a few important purposes:

Identifying Versions: Tagging allows you to specify versions or different variations of the same image. This is crucial for version control and managing different configurations or updates.

Naming Convention: Tagging helps maintain a clear naming convention for your images. It makes it easier to understand what each image represents, especially when you have multiple images or versions.

Pushing to Registry: Docker Hub (and most container registries) require images to be tagged before pushing them. The tag acts as a reference for the image within the registry.

Pulling Specific Versions: By tagging images, you can specify which version of the image to pull when deploying or running containers. This ensures consistency and reproducibility in your deployment process.

In summary, tagging images before pushing them to Docker Hub provides clarity, organization, and control over image versions, which are essential aspects of managing containerized applications effectively.
